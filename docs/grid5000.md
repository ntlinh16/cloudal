# Playing with Grid5000 

This tutorial to help you provision machines and then perform some actions on the reserved machines on [Grid5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Grid5000:Home).

If you donot have a Gri5k account yet, check out the [Grid5000:Get an account](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Grid5000:Get_an_account)

## 1. Setup to access nodes from outside Grid5000
If you want to run `cloudal` to interact with Grid5k system from your laptop (not on a grid5k frontend), you have to perform the following steps on your laptop.

1. Setup an alias for the access to any hosts inside Grid'5000. In `~/.ssh/config`, put these lines:
```
Host g5k
  User <your_g5k_username>
  Hostname access.grid5000.fr
  ForwardAgent no

Host *.g5k
  User <your_g5k_username>
  ProxyCommand ssh g5k -W "$(basename %h .g5k):%p"
  ForwardAgent no
```


2. Setup `~/.execo.conf.py` configuration file 

```
import re
  
default_connection_params = {
    'host_rewrite_func': lambda host: re.sub("\.grid5000\.fr$", ".g5k", host),
    'taktuk_gateway': 'g5k'
    }


default_frontend_connection_params = {
    'user': '<your_g5k_username>',
    'host_rewrite_func': lambda host: host + ".g5k"
    }

g5k_configuration = {
    'api_username': '<your_g5k_username>',
    }

```

These configurations follow the instruction of: 

- [Running from outside Grid5000](http://execo.gforge.inria.fr/doc/latest-stable/execo_g5k.html#running-from-outside-grid5000)

- [Using SSH ProxyCommand to access hosts inside Grid5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/SSH#Using_SSH_ProxyCommand_feature_to_ease_the_access_to_hosts_inside_Grid.275000)

## 2. Provision nodes on Grid5000
In this example, we provision some nodes on Grid5000 system.

First, edit the provision config file `provisioning_config_g5k.yaml` with your desired infrastructure description.

Then, run the following command to make the provision:
```
cd cloudal/examples/provision/
python provision_g5k.py --system_config_file provisioning_config_g5k.yaml -k
```

The `provision_g5k.py` script makes a reservation with the description in the provision config file `provisioning_config_g5k.yaml`: 10 nodes on *econome*, 3 nodes on *dahu* and 7 nodes on *graphite* clusters in 3 hours. These nodes are deployed with `debian10-x64-big` environment. 
The nodes are kept alive after the script is terminated (with `-k` option) so that you can connect to them.

## 3. Configure software on running Grid5000 nodes
In this example, we provision some nodes on Grid5000 and then install Docker and configure to ensure that Docker runs on these nodes.

First, we also need to edit the provision config file `provisioning_config_g5k.yaml` with your own desire.

Then, run the following command to provision and configure nodes:
```
cd cloudal/examples/configuration/
python config_docker_env_g5k.py --system_config_file provisioning_config_g5k.yaml -k
```

This `config_docker_env_g5k.py` script makes a reservation for nodes then install Docker on them.

You can modify the `config_host()` function in the script to install and configure your necessary applications.


## 4. Perform experiment: measuring Docker boot time on configured Grid5000 nodes
In this example, we provision some nodes on Grid5000 and then install Docker on these nodes.

First, edit the provision config file `provisioning_config_g5k.yaml` and the experimental setting file `exp_setting_docker_boottime.yaml` depends on your experiment setup.

Then, run the following command to perform experiment:
```
cd cloudal/examples/experiments/boottime/docker/
python docker_boottime_g5k.py --system_config_file provisioning_config_g5k.yaml --exp_setting_file exp_setting_docker_boottime.yaml -c /path/to/your/result/dir -k
```

The `docker_boottime_g5k.py` script (i) makes a reservation for nodes; then (ii) installs Docker on them and (iii) measures Docker boot time with different scenarios and saves all the results in a result directory.

You can modify the `_perform_experiments()` function in the script to design your own experiment scenarios.
