The main goals of `cloudal` is to perform large-scale reproducible experiments and collecting results automatically. `cloudal` consists of two main components: the Provisioning Cloud System module and the Performing Actions script. 

The `Provisioning Cloud System module` is responsible for returning to the client the required nodes with the OS installed. For each cloud system, I implement a provisioner to interract with that cloud system.

The `Performing Actions script` performs a specific action which can be provisioning, configuring or experimeting. Users have to write the their custom script to perform one or multiple actions such as only provisioning nodes, or provisioning and configuring nodes, or provisioning nodes and configuring sofware then running experiments on them.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/ntlinh16/cloudal.git
```
2. Activate your virtualenv (optional), and install the requirements.
```
cd cloudal
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
3. In other to run `execo`, we need to install `taktuk`
```
apt-get install taktuk
```

4. Set the `PYTHONPATH` to the directory of `cloudal`.
```
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/cloudal
```
You can add the above line to your `.bashrc` to have the env variable set on new shell session.

# Setup to access nodes from outside Grid5000
If you want to run `cloudal` an action on Grid5k system from  your laptop (not on a frontend), you have to perform the following steps.

1. Setup an alias for the access to any hosts inside Grid'5000. In `~/.ssh/config`, put these lines:
```
Host g5k
  User g5k_login
  Hostname access.grid5000.fr
  ForwardAgent no

Host *.g5k
  User g5k_login
  ProxyCommand ssh g5k -W "$(basename %h .g5k):%p"
  ForwardAgent no
```


2. Setup `~/.execo.conf.py` configuration file 

```
import re
  
default_connection_params = {
    'host_rewrite_func': lambd
    a host: re.sub("\.grid5000\.fr$", ".g5k", host),
    'taktuk_gateway': 'g5k'
    }


default_frontend_connection_params = {
    'user': '<g5k_username>',
    'host_rewrite_func': lambda host: host + ".g5k"
    }

g5k_configuration = {
    'api_username': '<g5k_username>',
    }

```

These configurations follow the instruction of `Grid5000` and `execo`:

# Usages

## 1. Provision nodes on Grid5000
In this example, we provision some nodes on Grid5000 system.

First, edit the provision config file `provisioning_config_g5k.yaml` with your desired infrastructure description.

Then, run the following command to make the provision:
```
cd cloudal/examples/provision/
python provision_g5k.py --system_config_file provisioning_config_g5k.yaml -k
```

The `provision_g5k.py` script makes a reservation with the description in the provision config file `provisioning_config_g5k.yaml`: 10 nodes on *econome*, 3 nodes on *dahu* and 7 nodes on *graphite* clusters in 3 hours. These nodes are deployed with `debian10-x64-big` environment. 
The nodes are kept alive after the script is terminated (with `-k` option) so that you can connect to them.

## 2. Configure software on running Grid5000 nodes
In this example, we provision some nodes on Grid5000 and then install Docker and configure to ensure that Docker runs on these nodes.

First, we also need to edit the provision config file `provisioning_config_g5k.yaml` with your own desire.

Then, run the following command to provision and configure nodes:
```
cd cloudal/examples/configuration/
python config_docker_env_g5k.py --system_config_file provisioning_config_g5k.yaml -k
```

This `config_docker_env_g5k.py` script makes a reservation for nodes then install Docker on them.

You can modify the `config_host()` function in the script to install and configure your necessary applications.


## 3. Perform experiment: measuring Docker boot time on configured Grid5000 nodes
In this example, we provision some nodes on Grid5000 and then install Docker on these nodes.

First, edit the provision config file `provisioning_config_g5k.yaml` and the experimental setting file `exp_setting_docker_boottime.yaml` depends on your experiment setup.

Then, run the following command to perform experiment:
```
cd cloudal/examples/experiments/boottime/docker/
python docker_boottime_g5k.py --system_config_file provisioning_config_g5k.yaml --exp_setting_file exp_setting_docker_boottime.yaml -c /path/to/your/result/dir -k
```

The `docker_boottime_g5k.py` script (i) makes a reservation for nodes; then (ii) installs Docker on them and (iii) measures Docker boot time with different scenarios and save all the result in a result directory.

You can modify the `_perform_experiments()` function in the script to design your own experiment scenarios.

## 4. Options
For each script, you might want to use `--help` to see all available options:
```
usage: <program> [options] <arguments>

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LOG_LEVEL          log level (int or string). Default = inherit execo
                        logger level
  -L                    copy stdout / stderr to log files in the experiment
                        result directory. Default = False
  -R                    redirect stdout / stderr to log files in the
                        experiment result directory. Default = False
  -M                    when copying or redirecting outputs, merge stdout /
                        stderr in a single file. Default = False
  -c DIR                use experiment directory DIR
  --system_config_file CONFIG_FILE_PATH
                        The path to the provisioning configuration file.
  --exp_setting_file EXP_SETTING_FILE_PATH
                        The path to the experiment setting file.
  -k                    Keep the reservation alive after deploying.
  -o                    Run the engine outside of grid5k charter
  -j OAR_JOB_IDS        the reserved oar_job_ids on grid5k. The format is
                        site1:oar_job_id1,site2:oar_job_id2,...
  --no-deploy-os        specify not to deploy OS on reserved nodes
